I choose an entertainment website for my theme. I named it pradee studio, which provides videography, audio engineering, and photography services.

I use javascript and CSS files to implement this page and ensure it is responsive.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I updated this project with server-side functionality using PHP.

Now you can submit messages, create an account, log in, and booking services.

I make the database "pradeestudio", and it's in the database folder.
1st download the entire zip file and extract it.

Next, create the database name as "pradeestudio" and import the pradeestudio.sql file in the database folder.

Afterward, you can submit messages, create an account, log in, and book services.

I used Wampserver 3.3.0 version to develop server-side functions using PHP MyAdmin.

For testing purposes use these user details.

**username-user1 and 
password-user11234** or,

**username-user and
password-user21234.**
